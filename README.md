After the previous parts of our lab, we are finally ready to simulate a day to day example of a help desk professional and now we are going to make up some tickts as a user with common issues that may occur within their company, business, etc. We do this through Support Center and create a few tickets and put them into their respective category giving us (the ones doing the lab) to be able to differentiate which department and who is responsible for taking care of these tickets.
